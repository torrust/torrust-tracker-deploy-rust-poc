//! Instance information retrieval step
//!
//! This module provides the `GetInstanceInfoStep` which retrieves instance
//! information from `OpenTofu` outputs. This step extracts essential instance
//! data like IP addresses and metadata from the infrastructure state.
//!
//! ## Key Features
//!
//! - Instance information extraction from `OpenTofu` state outputs
//! - Provider-agnostic interface through standardized outputs
//! - JSON parsing and data validation
//! - Integration with `OpenTofuClient` for state queries
//!
//! ## Information Retrieval
//!
//! The step uses `tofu output` to retrieve instance information including:
//! - IP addresses for network connectivity
//! - Instance names and identifiers
//! - Status and configuration metadata
//! - Provider-specific details as needed
//!
//! This provides a consistent interface for accessing instance information
//! regardless of the underlying infrastructure provider.
