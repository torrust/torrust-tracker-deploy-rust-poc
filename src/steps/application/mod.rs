//! Application deployment and lifecycle steps
//!
//! This module contains steps that manage application deployment and lifecycle
//! operations. These steps handle application-specific operations like deployment,
//! service management, configuration, and application health monitoring.
//!
//! ## Future Steps
//!
//! This module is prepared for future application deployment steps such as:
//! - Application container deployment
//! - Service configuration and startup
//! - Application health checks and validation
//! - Application lifecycle management
//!
//! ## Integration
//!
//! Application steps will integrate with the existing infrastructure and
//! software installation steps to provide complete deployment workflows
//! from infrastructure provisioning to application operation.

// Future modules to be added:
// pub mod compose_config;
// pub mod transfer_files;
// pub mod deploy;
// pub mod start_services;
// pub mod stop_services;
// pub mod get_status;
