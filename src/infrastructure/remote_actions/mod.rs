//! Remote actions module (Level 3 of Three-Level Architecture)
//!
//! This module provides the lowest-level operations in the three-level architecture,
//! containing leaf-level actions that directly interact with remote systems via SSH.
//! These actions are the building blocks used by steps (Level 2) and commands (Level 1).
//!
//! ## Available Remote Actions
//!
//! - `cloud_init` - Cloud-init status checking and validation
//! - `docker` - Docker installation and service management
//! - `docker_compose` - Docker Compose installation and validation
//!
//! ## Architecture Pattern
//!
//! Remote actions follow a consistent pattern:
//! - Take SSH connection and required parameters
//! - Execute specific remote operations via SSH
//! - Provide structured error handling with action context
//! - Return typed results for use by higher-level components
//!
//! These actions are designed to be atomic, testable, and reusable across
//! different deployment scenarios.

/// Remote actions are lightweight scripts that connect to a provisioned
/// server via SSH to perform various operations such as:

/// - Validating server state and configuration
/// - Retrieving server information (hostname, installed packages, etc.)
/// - Executing maintenance tasks (updates, cleanup, etc.)
/// - Installing or configuring software components

    /// # Arguments
    /// * `server_ip` - The IP address of the server to execute the action on
