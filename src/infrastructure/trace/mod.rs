//! Trace file generation infrastructure
//!
//! This module provides a scalable architecture for generating trace files
//! with command-specific writers and shared infrastructure.
//!
//! ## Module Structure
//!
//! - `writer` - Trace writing infrastructure
//!   - `sections` - Formatting utilities for trace sections
//!   - `error` - Error types for trace writing operations
