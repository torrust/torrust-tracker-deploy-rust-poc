## 📦 Phase 1: Quick Wins (1-2 hours)

High-impact improvements with minimal effort. Can be completed in a single PR.

### Proposal #1: Extract Magic Numbers to Named Constants

**Status**: ✅ Completed  
**Impact**: 🟢🟢🟢 High  
**Effort**: 🔵 Low  
**Priority**: P0

#### Problem

The fake PID `999_999_u32` in tests is a magic number without explanation, making the code less readable and harder to maintain.

#### Current Code

```rust
#[test]
fn it_should_clean_up_stale_lock_with_invalid_pid() {
    // ...
    let fake_pid = 999_999_u32;
    fs::write(&lock_file_path, fake_pid.to_string()).unwrap();
    // ...
}
```

#### Proposed Solution

```rust
// In tests module - add at the top level
/// PID value that is highly unlikely to be a running process
/// Used in tests to simulate stale locks from dead processes
const FAKE_DEAD_PROCESS_PID: u32 = 999_999;

#[test]
fn it_should_clean_up_stale_lock_with_invalid_pid() {
    // ...
    let fake_pid = FAKE_DEAD_PROCESS_PID;
    fs::write(&lock_file_path, fake_pid.to_string()).unwrap();
    // ...
}
```

#### Benefits

- ✅ Self-documenting code - clear intent
- ✅ Easy to update if needed across all tests
- ✅ Consistent test behavior

#### Implementation Checklist

- [x] Add `FAKE_DEAD_PROCESS_PID` constant to test module
- [x] Replace all instances of `999_999_u32` in tests
- [x] Verify all tests pass
- [x] Run linters

---

### Proposal #2: Replace `unwrap()` with Descriptive Error Messages

**Status**: ✅ Completed  
**Impact**: 🟢🟢🟢 High  
**Effort**: 🔵 Low  
**Priority**: P0

#### Problem

Tests use `.unwrap()` without context, making test failures harder to debug. When a test fails, developers don't get immediate context about what went wrong.

#### Current Code

```rust
#[test]
fn it_should_successfully_acquire_lock() {
    let scenario = TestLockScenario::new();
    let lock = scenario.acquire_lock();
    assert!(lock.is_ok());
    let lock = lock.unwrap(); // No context if this fails
    // ...
}
```

#### Proposed Solution

```rust
#[test]
fn it_should_successfully_acquire_lock() {
    let scenario = TestLockScenario::new();
    let lock = scenario.acquire_lock();
    assert!(lock.is_ok());
    let lock = lock.expect("Failed to acquire lock for basic operations test");
    // ...
}
```

#### Areas to Update

1. **TempDir creation**: `TempDir::new().expect("Failed to create temporary directory for test")`
2. **Lock acquisition in setup**: `.expect("Failed to acquire lock in test setup")`
3. **File operations**: `.expect("Failed to read lock file in test")`
4. **Thread operations**: `.expect("Failed to join test thread")`

#### Benefits

- ✅ Immediate context when tests fail
- ✅ Aligns with project's observability principles
- ✅ No performance cost
- ✅ Better developer experience

#### Implementation Checklist

- [x] Audit all `.unwrap()` calls in test code
- [x] Replace with `.expect()` with descriptive messages
- [x] Document pattern in testing conventions
- [x] Verify all tests pass with new messages

---

### Proposal #3: Add Builder Methods for Common Test Scenarios

**Status**: ✅ Completed  
**Impact**: 🟢🟢 Medium-High  
**Effort**: 🔵 Low  
**Priority**: P0

#### Problem

Many tests repeat the pattern of creating `TempDir`, file paths, and configuring timeouts. This leads to boilerplate and makes tests harder to read.

#### Current Code

```rust
#[test]
fn it_should_clean_up_stale_lock_with_invalid_pid() {
    let temp_dir = TempDir::new().unwrap();
    let file_path = create_temp_file_path(&temp_dir, "stale.json");
    let lock_file_path = FileLock::lock_file_path(&file_path);

    let fake_pid = 999_999_u32;
    fs::write(&lock_file_path, fake_pid.to_string()).unwrap();

    let lock_result = FileLock::acquire(&file_path, Duration::from_secs(1));
    // ...
}
```

#### Proposed Solution

Add convenience methods to `TestLockScenario`:

```rust
impl TestLockScenario {
    /// Create scenario with short timeout for failure tests (200ms)
    fn for_timeout_test() -> Self {
        Self::new().with_timeout(Duration::from_millis(200))
    }

    /// Create scenario with long timeout for success tests (5 seconds)
    fn for_success_test() -> Self {
        Self::new().with_timeout(Duration::from_secs(5))
    }

    /// Create a stale lock file with a dead process PID
    fn with_stale_lock(&self, fake_pid: u32) -> Result<(), std::io::Error> {
        fs::write(&self.lock_file_path(), fake_pid.to_string())
    }

    /// Create a lock file with invalid content for error testing
    fn with_invalid_lock(&self, content: &str) -> Result<(), std::io::Error> {
        fs::write(&self.lock_file_path(), content)
    }

    /// Create a lock file held by the current process
    fn with_current_process_lock(&self) -> Result<(), std::io::Error> {
        fs::write(&self.lock_file_path(), ProcessId::current().to_string())
    }
}
```

#### Example Usage

```rust
#[test]
fn it_should_clean_up_stale_lock_with_invalid_pid() {
    // Arrange
    let scenario = TestLockScenario::for_success_test()
        .with_file_name("stale.json");
    scenario.with_stale_lock(FAKE_DEAD_PROCESS_PID)
        .expect("Failed to create stale lock file");

    // Act
    let lock_result = scenario.acquire_lock();

    // Assert
    assert!(lock_result.is_ok());
    assert_lock_file_contains_current_pid(&scenario.file_path());
}
```

#### Benefits

- ✅ Less repetitive code
- ✅ More readable test setup
- ✅ Easier to maintain common patterns
- ✅ Self-documenting test scenarios

#### Implementation Checklist

- [x] Add builder methods to `TestLockScenario`
- [x] Refactor existing tests to use new methods
- [x] Add documentation for new methods
- [x] Verify all tests pass
- [x] Update testing conventions doc if needed

---

### Proposal #4: Extract Assertion Helpers into Granular Functions

**Status**: ✅ Completed  
**Impact**: 🟢🟢 Medium-High  
**Effort**: 🔵 Low  
**Priority**: P0

#### Problem

Current assertion helpers are limited and some checks are repeated across tests. More specific helpers would improve test readability.

#### Current Helpers

```rust
fn assert_lock_file_contains_current_pid(file_path: &Path) { /* ... */ }
fn assert_lock_file_absent(file_path: &Path) { /* ... */ }
```

#### Proposed Additional Helpers

```rust
/// Assert that lock file exists (without checking content)
fn assert_lock_file_exists(file_path: &Path) {
    let lock_file_path = FileLock::lock_file_path(file_path);
    assert!(
        lock_file_path.exists(),
        "Lock file should exist at {lock_file_path:?}"
    );
}

/// Assert that lock file contains specific PID
fn assert_lock_file_contains_pid(file_path: &Path, expected_pid: ProcessId) {
    let lock_file_path = FileLock::lock_file_path(file_path);
    let pid_content = fs::read_to_string(&lock_file_path)
        .expect("Should be able to read lock file");
    assert_eq!(
        pid_content.trim(),
        expected_pid.to_string(),
        "Lock file should contain PID {expected_pid}"
    );
}

/// Assert that lock acquisition failed with timeout error
fn assert_timeout_error(result: Result<FileLock, FileLockError>) {
    assert!(result.is_err(), "Expected timeout error");
    match result.unwrap_err() {
        FileLockError::AcquisitionTimeout { .. } => {},
        other => panic!("Expected AcquisitionTimeout, got: {other:?}"),
    }
}

/// Assert that lock acquisition failed with timeout and check holder PID
fn assert_timeout_error_with_holder(
    result: Result<FileLock, FileLockError>,
    expected_holder: ProcessId,
) {
    assert!(result.is_err(), "Expected timeout error");
    match result.unwrap_err() {
        FileLockError::AcquisitionTimeout { holder_pid, .. } => {
            assert_eq!(
                holder_pid,
                Some(expected_holder),
                "Expected holder PID {expected_holder}"
            );
        }
        other => panic!("Expected AcquisitionTimeout, got: {other:?}"),
    }
}

/// Assert that lock acquisition failed with invalid lock file error
fn assert_invalid_lock_file_error(
    result: Result<FileLock, FileLockError>,
    expected_content: &str,
) {
    assert!(result.is_err(), "Expected invalid lock file error");
    match result.unwrap_err() {
        FileLockError::InvalidLockFile { content, .. } => {
            assert_eq!(content, expected_content);
        }
        other => panic!("Expected InvalidLockFile, got: {other:?}"),
    }
}
```

#### Benefits

- ✅ Tests become more declarative
- ✅ Reusable across different test modules
- ✅ Easier to add new assertions
- ✅ Better error messages when assertions fail

#### Implementation Checklist

- [x] Add new assertion helper functions
- [x] Refactor existing tests to use helpers
- [x] Document assertion helpers
- [x] Verify all tests pass
- [x] Consider moving to shared test utilities if needed

## 🧪 Phase 2: Testability Enhancements (2-4 hours)

Medium-effort improvements that significantly enhance test quality and maintainability.

### Proposal #5: Introduce `LockAcquisitionState` Enum

**Status**: ✅ Completed  
**Impact**: 🟢🟢🟢 High  
**Effort**: 🔵🔵 Medium  
**Priority**: P1  
**Depends On**: None

#### Problem

The internal `acquire` logic is complex with multiple retry paths, making it hard to test specific scenarios in isolation. The state transitions during lock acquisition aren't explicitly modeled.

#### Proposed Solution

Extract the acquisition logic into a testable state machine:

```rust
/// Represents the state of lock acquisition process
///
/// This enum makes the lock acquisition state machine explicit and testable.
#[derive(Debug, PartialEq, Eq)]
enum LockAcquisitionState {
    /// Lock acquisition is being attempted
    Attempting,
    /// Found a lock held by a dead process (stale lock)
    FoundStaleLock(ProcessId),
    /// Lock is held by a live process
    Blocked(ProcessId),
    /// Lock was successfully acquired
    Acquired,
    /// Timeout occurred while waiting for lock
    TimedOut(ProcessId),
}

impl FileLock {
    /// Get the current state of lock acquisition (testable helper)
    ///
    /// This is primarily for testing to verify lock states without
    /// actually acquiring locks or waiting for timeouts.
    #[cfg(test)]
    fn check_lock_state(file_path: &Path) -> LockAcquisitionState {
        let lock_path = Self::lock_file_path(file_path);
        let current_pid = ProcessId::current();

        match Self::try_create_lock(&lock_path, current_pid) {
            Ok(()) => {
                // Clean up the lock file we just created for testing
                let _ = fs::remove_file(&lock_path);
                LockAcquisitionState::Acquired
            }
            Err(FileLockError::LockHeldByProcess { pid }) => {
                if pid.is_alive() {
                    LockAcquisitionState::Blocked(pid)
                } else {
                    LockAcquisitionState::FoundStaleLock(pid)
                }
            }
            Err(_) => LockAcquisitionState::Attempting,
        }
    }
}
```

#### Example Tests

```rust
#[test]
fn it_should_detect_acquired_state_when_no_lock_exists() {
    let scenario = TestLockScenario::new();
    let state = FileLock::check_lock_state(&scenario.file_path());
    assert_eq!(state, LockAcquisitionState::Acquired);
}

#[test]
fn it_should_detect_stale_lock_state() {
    let scenario = TestLockScenario::new();
    scenario.with_stale_lock(FAKE_DEAD_PROCESS_PID).unwrap();

    let state = FileLock::check_lock_state(&scenario.file_path());
    assert_eq!(state, LockAcquisitionState::FoundStaleLock(
        ProcessId::from_raw(FAKE_DEAD_PROCESS_PID)
    ));
}

#[test]
fn it_should_detect_blocked_state_when_lock_held() {
    let scenario = TestLockScenario::new();
    let _lock = scenario.acquire_lock().unwrap();

    let state = FileLock::check_lock_state(&scenario.file_path());
    assert_eq!(state, LockAcquisitionState::Blocked(ProcessId::current()));
}
```

#### Benefits

- ✅ Each state can be tested independently
- ✅ Better separation of concerns
- ✅ Easier to add new states in the future
- ✅ More explicit state machine logic
- ✅ Improved debugging capabilities

#### Implementation Checklist

- [x] Add `LockAcquisitionState` enum
- [x] Implement `check_lock_state()` test helper
- [x] Add unit tests for state detection
- [ ] Consider refactoring `acquire()` to use states explicitly (future enhancement)
- [x] Update documentation
- [x] Verify all tests pass

---

### Proposal #6: Make `ProcessId` Methods More Testable

**Status**: ❌ Cancelled  
**Impact**: 🟢🟢 Medium-High  
**Effort**: 🔵🔵 Medium  
**Priority**: P1 (Deferred)  
**Depends On**: None

**Note**: This proposal has been deferred for future consideration. The current implementation is sufficient for now.

#### Problem

`ProcessId::is_alive()` calls platform-specific code that's hard to mock in tests. This makes tests:

- Dependent on actual process states
- Slower (requires real system calls)
- Less deterministic (race conditions with real processes)

#### Proposed Solution

Introduce a trait for process status checking with test-friendly implementation:

```rust
/// Trait for checking process liveness (mockable in tests)
trait ProcessChecker {
    fn is_alive(&self, pid: ProcessId) -> bool;
}

/// Production implementation using platform-specific checks
struct SystemProcessChecker;

impl ProcessChecker for SystemProcessChecker {
    fn is_alive(&self, pid: ProcessId) -> bool {
        platform::is_process_alive(pid)
    }
}

/// Test implementation with configurable process states
#[cfg(test)]
struct MockProcessChecker {
    alive_pids: std::collections::HashSet<u32>,
}

#[cfg(test)]
impl MockProcessChecker {
    fn new() -> Self {
        Self {
            alive_pids: std::collections::HashSet::new(),
        }
    }

    fn with_alive_pid(mut self, pid: u32) -> Self {
        self.alive_pids.insert(pid);
        self
    }

    fn mark_alive(&mut self, pid: u32) {
        self.alive_pids.insert(pid);
    }

    fn mark_dead(&mut self, pid: u32) {
        self.alive_pids.remove(&pid);
    }
}

#[cfg(test)]
impl ProcessChecker for MockProcessChecker {
    fn is_alive(&self, pid: ProcessId) -> bool {
        self.alive_pids.contains(&pid.as_u32())
    }
}

impl ProcessId {
    /// Check if this process is currently alive (uses system checker)
    #[must_use]
    pub fn is_alive(&self) -> bool {
        self.is_alive_with(&SystemProcessChecker)
    }

    /// Check if process is alive with custom checker (primarily for testing)
    #[cfg(test)]
    fn is_alive_with(&self, checker: &dyn ProcessChecker) -> bool {
        checker.is_alive(*self)
    }
}
```

#### Example Tests

```rust
#[test]
fn it_should_detect_live_process_with_mock_checker() {
    let checker = MockProcessChecker::new()
        .with_alive_pid(12345);

    let pid = ProcessId::from_raw(12345);
    assert!(pid.is_alive_with(&checker));
}

#[test]
fn it_should_detect_dead_process_with_mock_checker() {
    let checker = MockProcessChecker::new(); // No alive PIDs

    let pid = ProcessId::from_raw(99999);
    assert!(!pid.is_alive_with(&checker));
}

#[test]
fn it_should_handle_process_state_changes() {
    let mut checker = MockProcessChecker::new();
    let pid = ProcessId::from_raw(54321);

    // Initially dead
    assert!(!pid.is_alive_with(&checker));

    // Mark alive
    checker.mark_alive(54321);
    assert!(pid.is_alive_with(&checker));

    // Mark dead again
    checker.mark_dead(54321);
    assert!(!pid.is_alive_with(&checker));
}
```

#### Benefits

- ✅ Testable without spawning real processes
- ✅ Faster tests (no system calls)
- ✅ More deterministic test behavior
- ✅ Easier to test edge cases
- ✅ Better separation of concerns

#### Implementation Checklist

- [ ] Add `ProcessChecker` trait
- [ ] Implement `SystemProcessChecker`
- [ ] Implement `MockProcessChecker` for tests
- [ ] Update `ProcessId::is_alive()` implementation
- [ ] Add tests for mock checker
- [ ] Refactor existing tests to use mock where appropriate
- [ ] Verify all tests pass
- [ ] Update documentation

### Proposal #7: Consolidate Duplicate Test Setup Code

**Status**: ✅ Completed  
**Impact**: 🟢🟢 Medium  
**Effort**: 🔵🔵 Low-Medium  
**Priority**: P1  
**Depends On**: Proposal #3 (shares similar goals)

**Note**: This proposal was completed through Proposal #3's TestLockScenario builder pattern, which provides a superior solution to the originally proposed fixture functions. All tests now consistently use the builder pattern for setup.

#### Problem

Several tests repeat similar setup patterns for creating temp directories, file paths, and acquiring locks. This violates the DRY principle and makes tests harder to maintain.

#### Proposed Solution

Create a dedicated test fixture module:

```rust
#[cfg(test)]
mod test_fixtures {
    use super::*;

    /// Setup for basic lock tests - returns temp dir and file path
    pub fn basic_lock_setup() -> (TempDir, PathBuf) {
        let temp_dir = TempDir::new()
            .expect("Failed to create temporary directory for test");
        let file_path = temp_dir.path().join("test.json");
        (temp_dir, file_path)
    }

    /// Setup for concurrent lock tests - returns temp dir and two cloned paths
    pub fn concurrent_lock_setup(file_name: &str) -> (TempDir, PathBuf, PathBuf) {
        let temp_dir = TempDir::new()
            .expect("Failed to create temporary directory for concurrent test");
        let file_path = temp_dir.path().join(file_name);
        let clone = file_path.clone();
        (temp_dir, file_path, clone)
    }

    /// Create a lock and verify it was acquired successfully
    pub fn acquire_and_verify(file_path: &Path, timeout: Duration) -> FileLock {
        let lock = FileLock::acquire(file_path, timeout)
            .expect("Failed to acquire lock in test setup");
        assert_lock_file_contains_current_pid(file_path);
        lock
    }

    /// Setup for stale lock testing - creates file with dead process PID
    pub fn setup_stale_lock(file_path: &Path, fake_pid: u32) {
        let lock_file_path = FileLock::lock_file_path(file_path);
        fs::write(&lock_file_path, fake_pid.to_string())
            .expect("Failed to create stale lock file for test");
    }

    /// Setup for invalid lock testing - creates file with invalid content
    pub fn setup_invalid_lock(file_path: &Path, content: &str) {
        let lock_file_path = FileLock::lock_file_path(file_path);
        fs::write(&lock_file_path, content)
            .expect("Failed to create invalid lock file for test");
    }
}
```

#### Example Usage

```rust
#[test]
fn it_should_successfully_acquire_lock() {
    // Arrange
    let (_temp_dir, file_path) = test_fixtures::basic_lock_setup();

    // Act
    let lock = FileLock::acquire(&file_path, Duration::from_secs(1));

    // Assert
    assert!(lock.is_ok());
    let lock = lock.expect("Lock should have been acquired");
    assert!(lock.acquired);
    assert_lock_file_contains_current_pid(&file_path);
}

#[test]
fn it_should_clean_up_stale_lock_with_invalid_pid() {
    // Arrange
    let (_temp_dir, file_path) = test_fixtures::basic_lock_setup();
    test_fixtures::setup_stale_lock(&file_path, FAKE_DEAD_PROCESS_PID);

    // Act
    let lock_result = FileLock::acquire(&file_path, Duration::from_secs(1));

    // Assert
    assert!(lock_result.is_ok());
    assert_lock_file_contains_current_pid(&file_path);
}
```

#### Benefits

- ✅ Follows DRY principle
- ✅ Consistent test setup across all tests
- ✅ Easier refactoring when setup needs change
- ✅ More readable test code
- ✅ Reduces boilerplate

#### Implementation Checklist

- [x] Create reusable test setup (via TestLockScenario builder in Proposal #3)
- [x] Implement setup methods (builder pattern with fluent API)
- [x] Refactor existing tests to use consistent pattern
- [x] Remove unused helper functions (create_temp_file_path)
- [x] Verify all tests pass
- [x] Document builder pattern in test module comments

## 🎨 Phase 3: Polish and Enhancement (4-6 hours)

Higher-effort improvements focusing on error handling, organization, and comprehensive testing.

### Proposal #8: Improve Error Context with Tiered Help System

**Status**: ✅ Completed  
**Impact**: 🟢🟢🟢 High  
**Effort**: 🔵🔵 Medium  
**Priority**: P2  
**Depends On**: None

#### Problem

Some errors lack actionable guidance per the project's development principles (Observability, Traceability, Actionability). Users need clear steps to resolve issues when locks fail, but verbose error messages with extensive troubleshooting steps can be overwhelming and violate the DRY principle.

#### Current State

Errors provide basic information but lack actionable guidance:

```rust
#[error("Failed to acquire lock for {path:?} within {timeout:?} (held by process {holder_pid:?})")]
AcquisitionTimeout {
    path: PathBuf,
    holder_pid: Option<ProcessId>,
    timeout: Duration,
},
```

#### Design Decision

After evaluating multiple approaches (see [Decision Record: Actionable Error Messages](../../docs/decisions/actionable-error-messages.md)), we've chosen a **tiered help system**:

1. **Base error message**: Concise with essential context
2. **Brief actionable tip**: One-liner hint in the error message
3. **`.help()` method**: Detailed troubleshooting available on-demand
4. **Rustdoc**: Developer-oriented documentation

This approach balances brevity with actionability without requiring external infrastructure or sacrificing runtime accessibility.

#### Proposed Solution

Enhance error messages with brief tips and add a `.help()` method for detailed troubleshooting:

**Error Definitions with Brief Tips:**

```rust
#[derive(Debug, Error)]
pub enum FileLockError {
    /// Failed to acquire lock within timeout period
    ///

#### Implementation Notes

**Platform-Specific Guidance:**
The `.help()` method provides platform-specific commands (Unix vs Windows) inline within the help text. This keeps the implementation simple while being actionable for all users.

**No External Infrastructure:**
All help content is embedded in the binary. This ensures:

- Help is always available at runtime
- No internet connection required
- No version synchronization issues
- Simple deployment

**Application Integration Example:**

```rust
// Example: Using .help() in application code
match FileLock::acquire(&path, timeout) {
    Ok(lock) => {
        // Use the lock
    }
    Err(e) => {
        eprintln!("Error: {e}");

        // Optionally show detailed help based on verbosity flag
        if verbose {
            eprintln!("\n{}", e.help());
        } else {
            eprintln!("Run with --verbose for detailed troubleshooting");
        }

        std::process::exit(1);
    }
}
```

#### Benefits

- ✅ Aligns with "Actionability" development principle
- ✅ Balances brevity with actionability
- ✅ No external infrastructure required
- ✅ Help always available at runtime
- ✅ Easy to maintain (help lives with error definition)
- ✅ Better user experience without overwhelming output
- ✅ Platform-aware guidance included
- ✅ No version stability concerns

#### Testing Requirements

Add tests to verify error message content and help availability:

```rust
#[test]
fn it_should_include_brief_tip_in_timeout_error() {
    let error = FileLockError::AcquisitionTimeout {
        path: PathBuf::from("/test/file.json"),
        holder_pid: ProcessId::from_raw(12345),
        timeout: Duration::from_secs(5),
    };

    let message = error.to_string();
    assert!(message.contains("Tip:"));
    assert!(message.contains("ps -p"));
}

#[test]
fn it_should_provide_detailed_help_for_all_error_variants() {
    let test_cases = vec![
        FileLockError::AcquisitionTimeout {
            path: PathBuf::from("/test/file.json"),
            holder_pid: ProcessId::from_raw(12345),
            timeout: Duration::from_secs(5),
        },
        FileLockError::CreateFailed {
            path: PathBuf::from("/test/file.json"),
            source: std::io::Error::new(std::io::ErrorKind::PermissionDenied, "test"),
        },
        // ... other variants
    ];

    for error in test_cases {
        let help = error.help();
        assert!(!help.is_empty(), "Help should not be empty");
        assert!(help.len() > 50, "Help should be detailed");
    }
}
```

#### Implementation Checklist

- [x] Update error variant definitions with Rustdoc and brief tips

### Proposal #9: Extract Platform Module to Separate File

**Status**: ✅ Completed  
**Impact**: 🟢🟢 Medium  
**Effort**: 🔵🔵🔵 Medium  
**Priority**: P2  
**Depends On**: None

#### Problem

The `platform` module is currently embedded within `file_lock.rs`, mixing platform-specific logic with the main file locking logic. This makes the module harder to navigate and test.

#### Current Structure

```text
src/infrastructure/persistence/filesystem/
├── file_lock.rs (700+ lines including platform module)
└── mod.rs
```

#### Proposed Structure

```text
src/infrastructure/persistence/filesystem/
├── file_lock.rs (main logic)
├── platform.rs (platform-specific process checking)
└── mod.rs
```

#### Proposed Implementation

**File: `src/infrastructure/persistence/filesystem/platform.rs`**

````rust
//! Platform-specific process checking functionality
//!
//! This module provides a unified interface for checking if a process is alive
//! across different operating systems (Unix and Windows).
//!
//! # Platform Support
//!
//! - **Unix/Linux/macOS**: Uses `kill -0` signal to check process existence
//! - **Windows**: Uses `tasklist` command to query running processes
//!
//! # Design
//!
//! The implementation uses command-line tools rather than OS APIs because:
//! - Simple and portable across different Unix flavors
//! - No additional dependencies required
//! - Sufficient for our use case (not performance-critical)

use crate::infrastructure::persistence::filesystem::file_lock::ProcessId;
use std::process::Command;

/// Check if a process with the given PID is currently running
///
/// # Platform Behavior
///
/// ## Unix/Linux/macOS
/// Uses `kill -0` which sends signal 0 to the process.
/// - Returns `true` if process exists and is accessible
/// - Returns `false` if process doesn't exist or permission denied
/// - Signal 0 doesn't actually send a signal, just checks permissions
///
/// ## Windows
/// Uses `tasklist /FI "PID eq {pid}"` to query process status.
/// - Returns `true` if process appears in task list
/// - Returns `false` if process doesn't exist
///
/// # Arguments
///
/// * `pid` - Process ID to check
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ```rust
/// use torrust_tracker_deploy::infrastructure::persistence::filesystem::platform;
/// use torrust_tracker_deploy::infrastructure::persistence::filesystem::file_lock::ProcessId;
///
/// let current_pid = ProcessId::current();

````

**File: `src/infrastructure/persistence/filesystem/file_lock.rs`** (updated)

```rust
// Remove the embedded platform module and add import
use super::platform;

// Rest of the file remains the same
```

**File: `src/infrastructure/persistence/filesystem/mod.rs`** (updated)

```rust
pub mod file_lock;
mod platform; // Add this line

// Re-export if needed
pub use file_lock::{FileLock, FileLockError, ProcessId};
```

#### Benefits

- ✅ Better separation of concerns
- ✅ Easier to test platform-specific code in isolation
- ✅ Cleaner main module (reduced line count)
- ✅ More discoverable code organization
- ✅ Easier to add new platform-specific functionality

#### Implementation Checklist

- [x] Create `platform.rs` file with module documentation
- [x] Move platform-specific code from `file_lock.rs`
- [x] Add tests to `platform.rs`
- [x] Update imports in `file_lock.rs`
- [x] Update `mod.rs` to include platform module
- [x] Verify all tests pass
- [x] Run linters
- [x] Update documentation references if needed

### Proposal #10: Add Multi-Process Integration Tests

**Status**: ✅ Completed  
**Impact**: 🟢🟢🟢 High  
**Effort**: 🔵🔵🔵 Medium-High  
**Priority**: P2  
**Depends On**: None

#### Problem

Current tests mostly simulate concurrency within a single process using threads. While useful, these don't test true inter-process locking scenarios, which are the primary use case for file locks.

#### Current Test Coverage

- ✅ Single process lock acquisition and release
- ✅ Thread-based concurrent access (same process)
- ✅ Stale lock detection
- ❌ **Missing**: True multi-process locking scenarios
- ❌ **Missing**: Lock handoff between processes
- ❌ **Missing**: Process crash scenarios

#### Proposed Solution

Add integration tests in the `tests/` directory that spawn actual child processes:

**File: `tests/file_lock_multiprocess.rs`**

````rust
//! Multi-Process Integration Tests for File Locking
//!
//! These tests spawn actual child processes to verify true inter-process locking
//! behavior. They are more comprehensive than unit tests but slower to run.
//!
//! # Running These Tests
//!
//! ```bash
//! # Run all multi-process tests
//! cargo test --test file_lock_multiprocess
//!
//! # Run with verbose output
//! cargo test --test file_lock_multiprocess -- --nocapture
//! ```
//!
//! # Test Strategy
//!
//! 1. Spawn child processes that hold locks for specific durations
//! 2. Verify parent process cannot acquire while child holds lock
//! 3. Verify lock is released when child exits
//! 4. Test crash scenarios by killing child processes

## 🔬 Phase 4: Advanced Observability (Optional, 2-3 hours)

Advanced improvements for production observability and debugging.

### Proposal #11: Add Tracing Spans for Lock Operations

**Status**: ✅ Completed  
**Impact**: 🟢🟢 Medium  
**Effort**: 🔵🔵🔵 Medium  
**Priority**: P3 (Optional)  
**Depends On**: None

#### Problem

Currently, lock operations have limited observability. When debugging issues in production, it's hard to trace:

- Which locks are being acquired and when
- How long lock acquisition takes
- Why locks are timing out
- The sequence of lock operations across the system

#### Proposed Solution

Add structured tracing throughout the lock lifecycle using the `tracing` crate:

```rust
use tracing::{debug, trace, warn, instrument};

impl FileLock {
    /// Attempt to acquire a lock for the given file path
    #[instrument(
        name = "file_lock_acquire",
        skip(file_path),
        fields(
            file = %file_path.display(),
            timeout_ms = timeout.as_millis(),
            pid = %ProcessId::current(),
        )
    )]
    pub fn acquire(file_path: &Path, timeout: Duration) -> Result<Self, FileLockError> {
        debug!("Attempting to acquire lock");

        let lock_file_path = Self::lock_file_path(file_path);
        let current_pid = ProcessId::current();
        let retry_strategy = LockRetryStrategy::new(timeout);

        trace!(
            lock_file = %lock_file_path.display(),
            "Lock file path determined"
        );

        let mut attempt = 0;
        loop {
            attempt += 1;
            trace!(attempt, "Lock acquisition attempt");

            match Self::try_acquire_once(&lock_file_path, current_pid) {
                AcquireAttemptResult::Success => {
                    debug!(attempts = attempt, "Lock acquired successfully");
                    return Ok(Self {
                        lock_file_path,
                        acquired: true,
                    });
                }
                AcquireAttemptResult::StaleProcess(pid) => {
                    warn!(
                        stale_pid = %pid,
                        attempt,
                        "Detected stale lock, cleaning up"
                    );
                    drop(fs::remove_file(&lock_file_path));
                }
                AcquireAttemptResult::HeldByLiveProcess(pid) => {
                    trace!(
                        holder_pid = %pid,
                        attempt,
                        elapsed_ms = retry_strategy.start.elapsed().as_millis(),
                        "Lock held by live process"

```

#### Example Tracing Output

With tracing configured, you would see:

```text
DEBUG file_lock_acquire{file="./data/env/state.json" timeout_ms=5000 pid=12345}: Attempting to acquire lock
TRACE file_lock_acquire{file="./data/env/state.json" timeout_ms=5000 pid=12345}: lock_file="./data/env/state.json.lock" Lock file path determined
TRACE file_lock_acquire{file="./data/env/state.json" timeout_ms=5000 pid=12345}: attempt=1 Lock acquisition attempt
TRACE file_lock_try_create{lock_file="./data/env/state.json.lock" pid=12345}: Attempting to create lock file
TRACE file_lock_try_create{lock_file="./data/env/state.json.lock" pid=12345}: Lock file created, writing PID
DEBUG file_lock_try_create{lock_file="./data/env/state.json.lock" pid=12345}: Lock file created successfully
DEBUG file_lock_acquire{file="./data/env/state.json" timeout_ms=5000 pid=12345}: attempts=1 Lock acquired successfully
```

#### Benefits

- ✅ Enhanced observability in production
- ✅ Easy debugging of lock contention issues
- ✅ Performance analysis (lock wait times)
- ✅ Audit trail of lock operations
- ✅ Integration with existing tracing infrastructure
- ✅ Aligns with "Observability" development principle

#### Testing Tracing

Add tests to verify tracing behavior:

```rust
#[cfg(test)]
mod tracing_tests {
    use super::*;
    use tracing_subscriber::layer::SubscriberExt;
    use tracing_subscriber::util::SubscriberInitExt;

    #[test]
    fn it_should_emit_trace_events_during_lock_operations() {
        // Setup tracing subscriber for testing
        let (subscriber, handle) = tracing_subscriber::fmt()
            .with_test_writer()
            .finish()
            .with_subscriber();

        let _guard = tracing::subscriber::set_default(subscriber);

        // Perform lock operation
        let scenario = TestLockScenario::new();
        let _lock = scenario.acquire_lock().unwrap();

        // Verify trace events were emitted
        // (Implementation depends on your tracing testing strategy)
    }
}
```

#### Implementation Checklist

- [x] Add `#[instrument]` attributes to public methods (acquire, release, try_create_lock)
- [x] Add strategic `trace!`, `debug!`, `warn!` calls throughout lock lifecycle
- [x] Add tracing context (attempt counts, PIDs, timings, file paths)
- [x] Test tracing output in development (runs with all tests)
- [x] Document tracing levels and output (in code comments)
- [x] Add tracing tests (5 new tests covering various scenarios)
- [x] Update observability documentation (tracing integrated throughout)
- [x] Verify all tests pass (28 file_lock + 5 tracing = 33 tests total, all passing)
- [x] Run linters (all 7 linters passing)
