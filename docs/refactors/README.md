# Refactoring

This directory contains detailed refactoring plans for improving the codebase. Each document outlines specific improvements, implementation strategies, and progress tracking.

## üìã Purpose

Refactoring plans serve to:

- **Document planned improvements** before implementation
- **Track progress** on ongoing refactoring work
- **Provide context** for reviewers and future maintainers
- **Align team** on technical improvements
- **Preserve decisions** and rationale

## üéØ Plan Structure

Each refactoring plan follows this structure:

1. **Overview**: Summary of goals and scope
2. **Progress Tracking**: Current status and completion metrics
3. **Phased Proposals**: Organized by impact and effort
4. **Implementation Details**: Code examples and checklists
5. **Timeline**: Estimated duration and sprint planning
6. **Review Process**: Approval and completion criteria

## üìä Status Legend

- üìã **Planning** - Document created, awaiting review and approval
- üöß **In Progress** - Implementation has started
- ‚úÖ **Completed** - All proposals implemented and merged
- ‚è∏Ô∏è **Paused** - Work temporarily suspended
- ‚ùå **Cancelled** - Plan was abandoned or superseded

## üîÑ Workflow

### 1. Creation

1. Identify area needing refactoring
2. Create detailed plan document in this directory
3. Organize proposals by impact/effort ratio
4. Add implementation checklists and timeline

### 2. Review and Approval

1. Team reviews plan for technical feasibility
2. Validate alignment with project principles
3. Approve or request modifications
4. Set implementation timeline

### 3. Implementation

1. Create tracking issue (optional)
2. Create feature branch
3. Implement proposals in priority order
4. Update progress in plan document
5. Run tests and linters after each change

### 4. Completion

1. Final verification of all changes
2. Update plan document status to ‚úÖ Completed
3. Create pull request
4. Merge after review approval

## üéì Best Practices

### When to Create a Refactoring Plan

Create a plan when:

- ‚úÖ Changes affect multiple functions or modules
- ‚úÖ Multiple improvements should be coordinated
- ‚úÖ Work will span multiple sessions or PRs
- ‚úÖ Team alignment is needed before starting
- ‚úÖ Changes require careful sequencing

Skip a formal plan for:

- ‚ùå Single-function improvements
- ‚ùå Obvious bug fixes
- ‚ùå Trivial style changes
- ‚ùå Urgent hotfixes

### Plan Quality

Good refactoring plans:

- ‚úÖ **Prioritize by impact/effort** - Quick wins first
- ‚úÖ **Include code examples** - Show before/after
- ‚úÖ **Provide checklists** - Track implementation steps
- ‚úÖ **Document rationale** - Explain why, not just what
- ‚úÖ **Set realistic timelines** - Based on team capacity
- ‚úÖ **Align with principles** - Support project goals

### Progress Tracking

Update progress regularly:

- **After each proposal**: Mark as completed
- **Weekly**: Update summary metrics
- **Phase completion**: Update phase status
- **Issues/blockers**: Document in plan

## üí° Tips

### For Plan Authors

- **Start with high-level goals** before diving into details
- **Group related changes** into logical phases
- **Estimate conservatively** - refactoring often takes longer than expected
- **Get early feedback** on the plan structure
- **Keep it updated** as implementation progresses

### For Implementers

- **Read the entire plan** before starting work
- **Follow the phase order** unless there's a strong reason not to
- **Update progress** after completing each proposal
- **Run tests frequently** to catch issues early
- **Ask questions** if anything is unclear

### For Reviewers

- **Check alignment** with project principles
- **Validate priorities** - are high-impact items first?
- **Verify feasibility** - can this actually be done?
- **Suggest improvements** - what's missing?
- **Approve clearly** - signal when implementation can begin

## üìû Questions?

- Open a GitHub issue with label `refactoring`
- Reference specific plan documents
- Tag relevant maintainers
