# Refactoring Plans

This directory contains detailed refactoring plans for improving the codebase. Each document outlines specific improvements, implementation strategies, and progress tracking.

## 📋 Purpose

Refactoring plans serve to:

- **Document planned improvements** before implementation
- **Track progress** on ongoing refactoring work
- **Provide context** for reviewers and future maintainers
- **Align team** on technical improvements
- **Preserve decisions** and rationale

## 📁 Active Refactoring Plans

| Document                                   | Status | Target | Created |
| ------------------------------------------ | ------ | ------ | ------- |
| _No active refactoring plans at this time_ |        |        |         |

## ✅ Completed Refactorings

| Document                          | Completed   | Target                    | Notes                                                                                                                                   |

| JSON File Repository Improvements | Oct 3, 2025 | `json_file_repository.rs` | See git history at `docs/refactors/json-file-repository-improvements.md` for the complete refactoring plan (9 proposals, all completed) |
| File Lock Improvements            | Oct 3, 2025 | `file_lock.rs`            | See git history at `docs/refactors/file-lock-improvements.md` for the complete refactoring plan (10 proposals, all completed)           |

## 🎯 Plan Structure

Each refactoring plan follows this structure:

1. **Overview**: Summary of goals and scope
2. **Progress Tracking**: Current status and completion metrics
3. **Phased Proposals**: Organized by impact and effort
4. **Implementation Details**: Code examples and checklists
5. **Timeline**: Estimated duration and sprint planning
6. **Review Process**: Approval and completion criteria

## 📊 Status Legend

- 📋 **Planning** - Document created, awaiting review and approval
- 🚧 **In Progress** - Implementation has started
- ✅ **Completed** - All proposals implemented and merged
- ⏸️ **Paused** - Work temporarily suspended
- ❌ **Cancelled** - Plan was abandoned or superseded

## 🔄 Workflow

### 1. Creation

1. Identify area needing refactoring
2. Create detailed plan document in this directory
3. Organize proposals by impact/effort ratio
4. Add implementation checklists and timeline

### 2. Review and Approval

1. Team reviews plan for technical feasibility
2. Validate alignment with project principles
3. Approve or request modifications
4. Set implementation timeline

### 3. Implementation

1. Create tracking issue (optional)
2. Create feature branch
3. Implement proposals in priority order
4. Update progress in plan document
5. Run tests and linters after each change

### 4. Completion

1. Final verification of all changes
2. Update plan document status to ✅ Completed
3. Create pull request
4. Merge after review approval

## 🎓 Best Practices

### When to Create a Refactoring Plan

Create a plan when:

- ✅ Changes affect multiple functions or modules
- ✅ Multiple improvements should be coordinated
- ✅ Work will span multiple sessions or PRs
- ✅ Team alignment is needed before starting
- ✅ Changes require careful sequencing

Skip a formal plan for:

- ❌ Single-function improvements
- ❌ Obvious bug fixes
- ❌ Trivial style changes
- ❌ Urgent hotfixes

### Plan Quality

Good refactoring plans:

- ✅ **Prioritize by impact/effort** - Quick wins first
- ✅ **Include code examples** - Show before/after
- ✅ **Provide checklists** - Track implementation steps
- ✅ **Document rationale** - Explain why, not just what
- ✅ **Set realistic timelines** - Based on team capacity
- ✅ **Align with principles** - Support project goals

### Progress Tracking

Update progress regularly:

- **After each proposal**: Mark as completed
- **Weekly**: Update summary metrics
- **Phase completion**: Update phase status
- **Issues/blockers**: Document in plan

## 💡 Tips

### For Plan Authors

- **Start with high-level goals** before diving into details
- **Group related changes** into logical phases
- **Estimate conservatively** - refactoring often takes longer than expected
- **Get early feedback** on the plan structure
- **Keep it updated** as implementation progresses

### For Implementers

- **Read the entire plan** before starting work
- **Follow the phase order** unless there's a strong reason not to
- **Update progress** after completing each proposal
- **Run tests frequently** to catch issues early
- **Ask questions** if anything is unclear

### For Reviewers

- **Check alignment** with project principles
- **Validate priorities** - are high-impact items first?
- **Verify feasibility** - can this actually be done?
- **Suggest improvements** - what's missing?
- **Approve clearly** - signal when implementation can begin
