# Development Principles

This document outlines the fundamental principles that guide the development of the Torrust Tracker Deploy application. These principles ensure the application is maintainable, reliable, and user-friendly.

## üîç Observability

**Core Principle**: If it happens, we can see it - even after it happens.

Observability is the primary principle that drives our development approach. Every component, operation, and interaction within the system must be transparent and traceable.

### Key Requirements

- **Comprehensive Logging**: All operations, decisions, and state changes must be logged with sufficient detail
- **Structured Data**: Use structured logging formats that enable easy parsing and analysis
- **Context Preservation**: Maintain context across operations to enable end-to-end tracing
- **Historical Visibility**: Ensure that past events can be reconstructed and analyzed

### Secondary Principle: Traceability (Deep Observability)

Traceability extends observability by ensuring that:

- Every action can be traced back to its origin
- The complete flow of operations is visible and reconstructible
- Dependencies and relationships between components are clear
- Impact analysis is possible for any change or failure

## üß™ Testability

**Core Principle**: Every component must be testable in isolation and as part of the whole.

The application architecture and code design must prioritize testability to ensure reliability and maintainability.

### Key Requirements

- **Unit Testing**: All functions and methods must be unit testable
- **Integration Testing**: Component interactions must be testable
- **End-to-End Testing**: Complete workflows must be testable
- **Test Environment Isolation**: Tests must not interfere with each other
- **Deterministic Behavior**: Components must behave predictably in test scenarios

## üë• User Friendliness

**Core Principle**: All errors must be clear, informative, and actionable.

User experience is paramount. Every error message and user interaction must be designed with the user's needs in mind.

### Error Message Requirements

#### Information Completeness (Relates to Traceability)

- **Context**: Provide complete context about what was happening when the error occurred
- **Root Cause**: Explain what specifically went wrong
- **Impact**: Describe what this means for the user's workflow
- **Correlation IDs**: Include identifiers that help trace the error in logs

#### User-Friendly Communication

- **Clear Language**: Use plain language that users can understand
- **Solution-Oriented**: Point users toward solutions, not just problems
- **Empathetic Tone**: Communicate errors in a helpful, non-blaming manner
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Show the most important information first, with details available if needed

## ‚ö° Actionability

**Core Principle**: The system must always tell the user how to continue in edge cases with detailed instructions.

When users encounter problems or edge cases, the system must provide clear guidance on next steps.

### Key Requirements

#### Detailed Instructions

- **Step-by-Step Guidance**: Provide specific, ordered steps for resolution
- **Command Examples**: Include exact commands or actions to take
- **Expected Outcomes**: Describe what should happen after following instructions
- **Alternative Paths**: Offer multiple approaches when possible

#### Edge Case Handling

- **Graceful Degradation**: Handle unexpected situations gracefully
- **Recovery Procedures**: Provide clear recovery steps for failure scenarios
- **Rollback Instructions**: Explain how to undo changes when needed
- **Support Information**: Direct users to additional help resources when needed

## üîß Implementation Guidelines

### For Developers

1. **Design with Observability**: Consider logging and tracing from the design phase
2. **Test-Driven Development**: Write tests before implementing functionality
3. **Error Message Review**: Have error messages reviewed by non-technical users
4. **Documentation First**: Document edge cases and their handling

For detailed guidance on implementing these principles in error handling, see the [Error Handling Guide](./contributing/error-handling.md).

### For Code Reviews

- Verify that new code includes appropriate logging
- Check that error messages are user-friendly and actionable
- Ensure that edge cases are handled with clear user guidance
- Confirm that the code is testable and includes appropriate tests

## üìã Success Metrics

- **Observability**: Can we trace any operation from start to finish?
- **Testability**: Is our test coverage comprehensive and meaningful?
- **User Friendliness**: Do users understand our error messages without external help?
- **Actionability**: Can users resolve issues independently using our guidance?

## üöÄ Continuous Improvement

These principles should evolve based on:

- User feedback and support requests
- Analysis of common failure patterns
- Developer experience and maintainability insights
- Industry best practices and tooling improvements

By following these principles, we ensure that the Torrust Tracker Deploy application remains reliable, maintainable, and user-focused throughout its development and operation.
