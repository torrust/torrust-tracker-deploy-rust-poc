# VM Providers Comparison: LXD vs Multipass

This document provides a detailed comparison between LXD containers and Multipass VMs for the Torrust tracker deployment infrastructure, explaining why LXD was chosen as the official provider.

## üîÑ Overview

For the Torrust tracker deployment infrastructure, we evaluated two main approaches for creating virtual environments that support cloud-init:

1. **LXD Containers** - System containers with cloud-init support
2. **Multipass VMs** - Full virtual machines with nested virtualization

## üéØ Why LXD is Our Official Choice

### ‚úÖ **Official GitHub Actions Support**

LXD has **official support** from the GitHub Actions team:

- Documented and guaranteed compatibility
- Long-term stability assurance
- Official troubleshooting support

**Multipass support is undocumented:**

- Works currently but no official guarantees
- Could break without notice in future GitHub runner updates
- No official support channel for issues

### ‚ö° **Performance Benefits**

**LXD containers provide superior performance:**

- **Boot time**: 5-10 seconds vs 30-60 seconds for Multipass
- **Resource usage**: Shared kernel means lower memory and CPU overhead
- **Storage efficiency**: Container filesystems are more efficient than VM disk images

### üîß **CI/CD Optimization**

**LXD is better suited for automated testing:**

- Faster spin-up times reduce CI job duration
- Lower resource requirements allow more parallel jobs
- Predictable performance characteristics

### üèóÔ∏è **Infrastructure Consistency**

**LXD provides better DevOps alignment:**

- Container-based approach aligns with modern cloud practices
- Easier to version and distribute container images
- Better integration with container orchestration if needed

## üß™ When to Use Each Approach

### Use LXD Containers When:

- ‚úÖ **CI/CD environments** (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, etc.)
- ‚úÖ **Development environments** requiring fast iteration
- ‚úÖ **Testing scenarios** where performance matters
- ‚úÖ **Container-based workflows**
- ‚úÖ **Resource-constrained environments**

### Use Multipass VMs When:

- üî¨ **Complete isolation** is required
- üî¨ **Kernel-level testing** (different kernels, kernel modules)
- üî¨ **Legacy application testing** requiring specific kernel features
- üî¨ **Security testing** requiring hardware-level isolation
- üî¨ **Experimental development** where official support isn't critical

## üöÄ Getting Started with Each

### LXD Quick Start

```bash
# Install LXD
sudo snap install lxd
sudo lxd init --auto
sudo usermod -a -G lxd $USER
newgrp lxd

# Deploy with OpenTofu
cd config/tofu/lxd
tofu init && tofu apply
```

### ~~Multipass Quick Start~~ (Deprecated)

> **Note**: Multipass support has been removed from this project as of the LXD over Multipass decision.
> For Multipass-related documentation and examples, see: https://github.com/torrust/torrust-tracker-deploy-rust-poc

```bash
# Multipass is no longer supported in this repository
# See the link above for Multipass examples and documentation
